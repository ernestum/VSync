    SimpleSender

    This example demonstrates how to keep a value from an 
    analog pin in sync with a Processing sketch.
    It can be used together with the SimpleReceiver example of the 
    Processing version of this library.

//  Put the number of variables you want to sync in the pointy brackets
//  Here we just want to sync one value

//  here we store the value we read from analog bin A0

  //  Make sure to use the same baudrate on both ends. More baud = more speed
  Serial.begin(19200);

  //  Tell the sending syncronizer what variable needs to be kept in sync.
  //  In this case it is just the variable 'analogValue' but if you sync more,
  //  you need to make sure to use the same order on the sending and the receiving side.
  sender.observe(analogValue);

  // Read a value from analog pin A0. You could hook up a LDR or a potmeter.

  //  You need to call sync() for once every loop.
  //  It does not matter where you call it but for the ValueSender
  //  it makes sense at the end.
